			<div class = "hrLine3">
				<p>Captain of the Stars is a table-top strategy game designed for 3-6 players. The game places you in the boots of a captain just trying to make his or her mark on the galaxy through renown or fear. Each player commands their own upgradeable ship, assembles a crew, manages resources, places settlements, and fights off other players. I developed this game in a group of 5 people with my role being that of Design Lead and minor Asset Production. I contributed to the design of the theme and mechanics of the game as well as 3D-modeled, printed, and painted the Players' ship pieces.</p>
