					<p>
						My name is Noah Kellem and I am a 21 year old game design student graduating in 
						May of 2018 from Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelors of Science in
						Game Design and Development currently seeking a Co-op for the Fall of 2017.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						I believe games have a way of telling a story like no other medium out there. They allow
						people to connect deeply with the stories they are being told by placing them smack dab
						in the middle of the action and immersing the player completely within the plot.
						<br />
						<br />
						I believe games have the potential to bring out the strongest emotional responses within people.
						They can tell incredibly personal stories that reach even the deepest emotional levels
						and make people feel incredibly powerful emotions. I believe this, because this is exactly how
						my favorite games have affected me.
						<br/>
						<br />
						And this is exactly why I want to make games. I want to be able to cause another human being
						to feel the same way I have felt. I want to be the one to help elicit those extreme and powerful
						emotional responses in others through my greatest passion. Games are special all on their own, but I want
						to turn that something special into something extraordinary.
